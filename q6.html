. Write the following programs:
 - Write a JavaScript program that will create a new array of size b.length. Each element in this new array will be 
    10 * the correspoding element in b - 5. Then, loop through the elements of b and the new array, and print 
    the sum of each corresponding pair.
 - Write the same program in Ruby

var b = [5, 10, 23, 10, 7, 9, 39, 16, 1, 12, 36, 20, 50];
var x=[ ];
var y=[ ];

for (i=0;i<b.length;i++){
	x[i]=(b[i]*10)-5;
	y[i]=x[i]+b[i];
}

	console.log(x);

	console.log(y);
	


#Ruby



b = [5, 10, 23, 10, 7, 9, 39, 16, 1, 12, 36, 20, 50]
x=[]
y=[]

(0..(b.length-1)).step(1) do |i|
	x[i]=(b[i]*10)-5
	y[i]=x[i]+b[i]
	
	end
	

	puts(x)

	puts(y)
